3d-cube--image-slider-
======================

I'm trying to make something:
http://colincej.ca/cubes/cube3.html

I'm trying to use some of the new 3d css techniques I've seen around to make a cube based images slider! (so fun!)
I'm actually pretty new to jQuery and Javascript and amd really struggling trying to get this working. Basically I would like to have the full sized image at the start, then onclick --> cube borders appear --> cubes rotate DIFFERENT directions at DIFFERENT times --> borders disappear --> everyone impressed. The issue I'm having is getting the timing to delay properly so each cube rotates at a different time if anyone has any suggestions I would be so very happy. I have tried random math with - > .css delay with a loop (its in the code but is commented out) but although when testing the console.log showed different values for each delay, they all rotate at the same time!
